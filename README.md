DriverPass System Analysis & Design

This repository showcases two major deliverables from the DriverPass project completed in CS 255: Systems Analysis and Design. These documents demonstrate my ability to collect business requirements and translate them into a working system design.

Submitted Artifacts

- `BusinessRequirementsDocument_ProjectOne.docx`  
  This file contains the full business requirements document developed in Project One. It outlines the purpose, functional and nonfunctional requirements, stakeholder needs, and project schedule.

- `SystemDesignDocument_ProjectTwo.docx`  
  This file includes key UML diagrams (use case, activity, sequence, class) and defines the technical infrastructure for the DriverPass system. It builds on the requirements in Project One to present a full implementation-ready design.

Project Reflection

Brief Summary  
The DriverPass project was developed for a fictional client named DriverPass, a company focused on helping students pass their driver’s license exams. The client noticed a gap in existing resources, where most students failed by only relying on previous written tests. Our task was to design a comprehensive system that provided both online practice exams and tools to schedule real-world driving lessons. The system needed to serve students, instructors, and administrators with different levels of access and functionality.

What I Did Well  
I believe I did especially well in organizing requirements clearly and consistently across both documents. The functional and nonfunctional needs were translated into real features, and I maintained clear alignment from analysis to design. The use of a blended modeling approach (object and process) also helped capture different dimensions of the system effectively.

What I Would Revise  
If I could revise one part, I would improve the visual integration of UML diagrams in the system design document. I created diagrams using Lucidchart, but for better clarity and portfolio presentation, I would embed high-resolution exports of each diagram directly within the document and label them more explicitly (e.g., “UC1 – Student Schedules Lesson”).

How I Interpreted and Met User Needs  
To meet user needs, I closely reviewed the interview transcript and extracted stakeholder expectations. From there, I categorized features by user type—students, instructors, admins—and made sure each had the tools they required. This interpretation was reflected in the use case diagram and activity models, which centered on key workflows like scheduling and lesson tracking. Considering the user is essential because the success of any software depends on how well it meets real-world expectations and solves actual problems. A technically sound system that ignores the user experience will ultimately fail to deliver value.

My Approach to Software Design  
I approach software design with a user-first mindset, grounded in real-world use cases. I start by identifying user roles, mapping out tasks and information flow, then modeling the data with object-based structures. For future projects, I plan to make even greater use of modular, reusable class structures, agile feedback loops, and rapid prototyping to ensure design decisions are validated early. Visual tools like UML remain a staple, but I’ll also explore user story mapping and iterative wireframes to improve future analysis and design efforts.
